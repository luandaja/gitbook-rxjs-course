# Changing the paradigm - Part 1

Before start with ReactiveX we need to be aware about the mindset change that we need.

## ðŸ§  Pull vs Push architectures

### Pull architecture

![Common &quot;push&quot; architecture](../.gitbook/assets/observable-pattern-1.png)

The pull architecture refers to when the client "push" a request to the server. This is the most famous example: Client makes a data request to the server and the server response with the data. The main characteristic of this approach is **the client manually make the request.**

### Push architecture

Contrary to pull architectures, the push approach requires the client to wait for the notification from a source.
